# Exploring spire

This workshop is about exploring what spire has to offer. Since I agreed to
do this on very short notice, just let me know what interests you.

# Setting up the tooling

Here are the basics you will need for any scala development:

-   Git ([downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for all platforms)
-   Java 8 JDK ([downloads](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) for all
    platforms)
-   SBT (setup for [Linux](http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/Installing-sbt-on-Linux.html) \|
    [Windows](http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/Installing-sbt-on-Windows.html) \|
    [Mac](http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/Installing-sbt-on-Mac.html))

# Downloading the code and the dependencies

Now you're ready to download and start using the starter project:

1. `git clone https://github.com/rklaehn/spire-codeeurope-2017`
1. `cd spire-codeeurope-2017`
1. `sbt test:compile`
